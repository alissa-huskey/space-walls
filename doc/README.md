Notes
=====

This directory contains the information I gathered while researching this project.

* [System Images](system-images.md): Where the default system images are located.
* [Wallpapers Database](wallpapers-database.md): Where the information is stored for desktop images and how to parse it.
* [Spaces Plist](spaces-plist.md): Where the information is stored about your spaces configuration and how to access it.
* [Javascript for Automation](jxa.md): Notes on how to change desktop settings via JXA (which does not accomplish my goals).
