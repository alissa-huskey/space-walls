Mac OS Wallpapers
=================

This project is for a command-line tool to change the wallpapers on each
individual space (desktop) on macOS.

There are other projects that do this such as [pywal][pywal]. But I haven't
found one that supports different wallpapers for each desktop/space.

[pywal]: https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal

Usage
-----

This command will display the current desktop image per space according to the
`desktoppicture.db`.

```
walls
```

Status
------

Defunct.

It turns out that the way wallpapers are managed under the hood has changed as
of macOS 14. So this project is basically useless.

Alternatives
------------

These projects are more established, but don't suit my needs.
