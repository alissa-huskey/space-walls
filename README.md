Mac OS Wallpapers
=================

This project is for a command-line tool to change the wallpapers on particular spaces.

There are other projects that do this such as [pywal][pywal]. But I haven't
found one that supports different wallpapers for each desktop/space.

Status
------

Planning.

So far I've just done a bunch of research. The information I've gathered can be
found in [notes.md](doc/notes.md).

Alternatives
------------

These projects are more established, but don't suit my needs.

* [sindresorhus/macos-wallpaper][macos-wallpaper]
